Demonstrated here is the Procedure of Incorporating and Using Resource Tuner APIs for Resource Provisioning by a Client.

To make use of these APIs, the Client needs to add the "ResourceTuner/ResourceTunerAPIs.h" Header to their code, where all the APIs are declared.

Refer:
- ResourceTunerCoreAPIs.cpp: For usage of tuneResources / untuneResources / retuneResources APIs
- For usage of Resource Tuner APIs in C-based programs, ResourceTunerCoreAPIs.c
