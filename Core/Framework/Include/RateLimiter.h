 * \details To Prevent abuse of the system, Rate Limiting checks have been added.\n
 *          This is implemented via the “RateLimiter” component.\n\n
 *          Each client on initialization gets a pre-defined “health” of 100.
 *          We follow a Reward / Punish mechanism. Where a punishment implies a decrease in the\
 *          health and a reward result in an increment in health (upto 100 max).
 *          If the client health drops to a value <= 0, then the client shall be dropped, i.e. any
 *          further requests sent by the client will be dropped without any further processing.\n\n
 *          How are Punishment and Rewards Defined: RateLimiter provides a time interval “delta”, say 5 ms. If a client sends 2 requests within a time interval smaller than delta, then we punish the client. If consecutive client requests are suitably spaced out, we reward the client for good behavior.
