Demonstrated here is the Procedure of Incorporating and Using Systune APIs for Resource Provisioning by a Client.

To make use of these APIs, the Client needs to add the "Systune/SystuneAPIs.h" Header to their code, where all the APIs are declared.

Refer:
- SystuneCoreAPIs.cpp: For usage of tuneResources / untuneResources / retuneResources APIs
