Demonstrated here is the Procedure of Incorporating and Using Systune APIs for Resource Provisioning by a Client.

To make use of these APIs, the Client needs to add the the "SystuneAPIs.h" Header to their code, where all the APIs are declared.

Note: The Client just needs to invoke the right API, the Systune Client Module will take care
of all the details of encoding the Request Message and sending it to the Systune Server for
Processing.
